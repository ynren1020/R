Weekend project: I used Posit PBC's Shiny Assistant to rewrite my Recyclebot app front end (which I originally write in Chainlit) in Shiny for Python.
I ended up first re-doing it in Streamlit, which is a more common codebase for an LLM to understand. It took a couple of hours to work through all the kinks, but it's live now at https://lnkd.in/eh_9wB8J

Shiny Assistant is a great resource if you're building Shiny apps in either R or Python!
